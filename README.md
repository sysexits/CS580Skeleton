# CS580 OpenGL Skeleton for Mac OS X

## Introduction

This is CS580 OpenGL Skeleton for students who use Mac OS X.

## Compiling issues

Go to [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), and follow in the guide. After you install homebrew, install GLEW and GLFW3 using brew. I skip this part, because this is machine dependent part, so you need to check your library version and edit Makefile for your system.

Some students don't have X11 dev library in their system, in that case, you also need to install XQuartz library for development system.

## Execute your binary

Just make, and execute with ./program

## Reporting bugs

Bugs are reported to [issue tracker].
If it's a build issue, please also include the build log and version of your development environment.

## Contact

The official email address is attached in syllabus, but you don't know it, just email to sysexits(gmail).
